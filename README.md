Automated Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Deployment and Monitoring
Developed and Deployed CI/CD Pipeline: Designed and implemented a CI/CD pipeline for managing applications across AWS, Azure, and GCP. Used Terraform to automate the provisioning of resources including VMs, databases, and load balancers. Integrated Jenkins and Kubernetes for seamless continuous deployment.

Implemented Monitoring and Scaling Solutions: Integrated Prometheus for real-time monitoring and Grafana for visualization and alerting. This setup reduced deployment time by 50% and ensured high availability with automated scaling and real-time monitoring, significantly improving system reliability and performance.
